ABSTRACT = {This study is related to Smart Aqua Farm, which combines artificial intelligence (AI) and Internet of things (IoT) technology. This study aimed to monitor fish growth in indoor aquaculture while automatically measuring the average size and area in real time. Automatic fish size measurement technology is one of the essential elements for unmanned aquaculture. Under the condition of labor shortage, operators have much fatigue because they use a primitive method that samples the size and weight of fish just before fish shipment and measures them directly by humans. When this kind of process is automated, the operator’s fatigue can be significantly reduced. Above all, after measuring the fish growth, predicting the final fish shipment date is possible by estimating how much feed and time are required until the fish becomes the desired size. In this study, a video camera and a developed light-emitting grid panel were installed in indoor aquaculture to acquire images of fish, and the size measurement of a mock-up fish was implemented using the proposed method.},

ABSTRACT = {Many studies have reported that the human body-balance ability was essential in the early detection and self-management of chronic diseases. However, devices to measure balance, such as motion capture and force plates, are expensive and require a particular space for installation as well as specialized knowledge for analysis. Therefore, this study aimed to propose and verify a new algorithm to score the human body-balance ability on the wobble board (HBBAWB), based on a geometric solution using a cheap and portable device. Although the center of gravity (COG), the projected point of the center of mass (COM) on the fixed ground, has been used as the index for the balance ability, generally, it was not proper to use the COG under the condition of no fixed environment. The reason was that the COG index did not include the information on the slope for the wobble. Thus, this study defined the new index as the perpendicular-projection point (PPP), which was the projected point of the COM on the tilted plane. The proposed geometric solution utilized the relationship among three points, the PPP, the COM, and the middle point between the two feet, via linear regression. The experimental results found that the geometric solution, which utilized the relationship between the three angles of the equivalent model, enabled us to score the HBBAWB.},
