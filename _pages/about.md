# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. #The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of #the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-#folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons]#(https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.


My name is Huynh Nguyen Ngoc, and I specialize in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I earned my B.S. degree from the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Science, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, in 2019. Subsequently, I completed my M.S. degree in AI Convergence at Chonnam National University, South Korea, in 2023.

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. with a research focus on aquaculture and fish tracking. My work centers on applying deep learning techniques to develop innovative solutions for smart farming, aiming to improve efficiency and promote sustainability in the aquaculture industry.
