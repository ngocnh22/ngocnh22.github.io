My name is Huynh Nguyen Ngoc, and I specialize in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I earned my B.S. degree from the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Science, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, in 2019. Subsequently, I completed my M.S. degree in AI Convergence at Chonnam National University, South Korea, in 2023.

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. with a research focus on aquaculture, fish tracking, and robust visual perception in challenging environments. My work applies advanced deep learning techniques such as Retinex-based enhancement, low-light and underwater image restoration, and camouflaged object detection to develop intelligent and reliable solutions for smart farming, aiming to improve efficiency and promote sustainability in the aquaculture industry.
