My name is Huynh Nguyen Ngoc, and I specialize in the field of Artificial Intelligence. I earned my B.S. degree from the Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Science, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City, in 2019. Subsequently, I completed my M.S. degree in AI Convergence at Chonnam National University, South Korea, in 2023.

Currently, I am pursuing a Ph.D. with a research focus on aquaculture and fish tracking. My work centers on applying deep learning techniques to develop innovative solutions for smart farming, aiming to improve efficiency and promote sustainability in the aquaculture industry.
